# Enhanced SQS Security & Encryption Testing Guide

## 🚀 Enhanced Features

The SQS testing tools now include comprehensive **encryption analysis** and **risk-based recommendations** to help you prioritize security improvements.

## 📊 New Risk Assessment System

### Risk Levels:
- **🔴 Critical Risk** - Immediate action required (anonymous access + no encryption)
- **🟠 High Risk** - Priority action required (public access or no encryption)
- **🟡 Medium Risk** - Review recommended (blank policies)
- **🟢 Low Risk** - Monitoring recommended (properly configured)

### Risk Factors:
1. **No encryption enabled** (+3 points)
2. **Anonymous access enabled** (+5 points)
3. **Public access enabled** (+4 points)
4. **Blank policy** (+1 point)

## 🔍 Enhanced Testing Script

### Basic Usage:
```bash
# Test all queues in your account
python sqs_queue_tester.py

# Test specific queues
python sqs_queue_tester.py --queues "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/my-queue"

# Test in different region
python sqs_queue_tester.py --region us-west-2

# Generate markdown report
python sqs_queue_tester.py --output security_report.md

# Test specific queues and save report
python sqs_queue_tester.py --queues "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/my-queue" --output my_queues_report.md
```

## 🔐 Encryption Enabler Script

### Features:
- **SSE-SQS encryption** (AWS managed)
- **KMS encryption** (Customer managed)
- **Automatic testing** after encryption
- **Interactive setup** for multiple queues
- **KMS key discovery** and selection

### Usage Examples:

#### Enable SSE-SQS encryption on a single queue:
```bash
python enable_sqs_encryption.py --queues "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/my-queue"
```

#### Enable KMS encryption on a queue:
```bash
python enable_sqs_encryption.py --queues "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/my-queue" --encryption-type kms --kms-key-id alias/my-key
```

#### Interactive setup for multiple queues:
```bash
python enable_sqs_encryption.py --queues "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/queue1" "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/queue2"
```

### Interactive Setup Example:
```
🔐 SQS Queue Encryption Setup
==================================================

📋 Available KMS Keys:
   1. alias/my-app-key - Application encryption key
   2. alias/sensitive-data-key - Sensitive data encryption
   3. Use SSE-SQS (AWS managed)

🔧 Encryption Options:
   1. SSE-SQS (AWS managed) - Recommended for most cases
   2. KMS (Customer managed) - For sensitive data

Select encryption type (1 or 2): 1

🔐 Enabling encryption on: https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/my-queue

## 🎯 Prioritization Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Immediate)
1. **Disable anonymous access** on all queues
2. **Enable encryption** on queues with sensitive data
3. **Review public access** permissions

### Phase 2: High Priority (This Week)
1. **Enable encryption** on remaining queues
2. **Upgrade to KMS** for sensitive data
3. **Implement explicit policies** where needed

### Phase 3: Medium Priority (This Month)
1. **Review IAM permissions** for blank policy queues
2. **Monitor access patterns** using CloudTrail
3. **Document security configurations**

### Phase 4: Ongoing (Continuous)
1. **Regular security audits**
2. **Monitor for new security issues**
3. **Keep encryption and policies up to date**

## 🔧 Encryption Types

### SSE-SQS (AWS Managed)
- **Use case**: Most queues, non-sensitive data
- **Cost**: No additional cost
- **Management**: AWS handles key rotation
- **Compliance**: Meets most compliance requirements

### KMS (Customer Managed)
- **Use case**: Sensitive data, compliance requirements
- **Cost**: $1/month per key + usage
- **Management**: You control key rotation
- **Compliance**: Meets strict compliance requirements

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Before Enabling Encryption:
- [ ] Test on non-production queues first
- [ ] Verify applications have proper IAM permissions
- [ ] Check for any hardcoded queue URLs
- [ ] Review CloudWatch metrics for baseline

### After Enabling Encryption:
- [ ] Test message sending/receiving
- [ ] Monitor for any errors in applications
- [ ] Check CloudWatch metrics for changes
- [ ] Update documentation

### Ongoing Security:
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Monitor CloudTrail for access patterns
- [ ] Review and update policies as needed
- [ ] Keep encryption configurations current

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "Access Denied" after enabling encryption:
- Check IAM permissions for KMS key usage
- Verify the role/user has `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey` permissions

#### Queue not working after encryption:
- Test with AWS CLI first: `aws sqs send-message --queue-url <url> --message-body "test"`
- Check CloudWatch logs for application errors
- Verify the queue URL hasn't changed

#### KMS key not found:
- Ensure the KMS key exists in the same region as the queue
- Check that the key is enabled and not scheduled for deletion
- Verify you have permissions to use the key

## 📞 Support
